        <h2>63-Days: A timeline of events</h2>
        <h3>1 August</h3>
        <p>
            The outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. At 1.50pm in Żoliborz, nearby pl. Wilsona, the first fighting of the Uprising took place. 5pm is recorded as the official start of the Warsaw Uprising.
        </p>
        <h3>2 August</h3>
        <p>
            Insurgents seize strategic points in the city including in the Old Town, Śródmieście, Powiśle and Czerniaków.
        </p>
        <h3>5 August</h3>
        <p>
            &#8216;Black Saturday&#8217; &#8211; the mass murder of civilians in Wola and continues for another 2 days.
        </p>
        <h3>20 August</h3>
        <p>
            Seizing of the Polish Joint-Stock Telephone Company (the so-called PAST-a) building at 37/39 Zielna street. The insurgents take around 115 German prisoners.
        </p>
        <h3>1 September</h3>
        <p>
            German assault on the Old Town. The insurgents evacuate through canals to Śródmieście and Żoliborz.
        </p>
        <h3>2 September </h3>
        <p>
            During the early hours of the morning, tank shells smash Sigismund&#8217;s Column. The Germans capture the Old Town. Fighting in other parts of Warsaw continues.
        </p>
        <h3>10 September</h3>
        <p>
            The Red Army begins an offensive from the Praga bank of the Vistula.
        </p>
        <h3>18 September</h3>
        <p>
            107 American B-17s make the biggest airdrop of weapons, ammunition, food and medicine. Unfortunately, the insurgents only managed to pick up only 20% of what was dropped.
        </p>
        <h3>2 October</h3>
        <p>
            The Uprising falls. The capitulation order is signed in Ożarów, bringing fighting in Warsaw to an end. The order grants the insurgents full prisoner-of-war status protected under the Geneva Convention, and offers protections to civilians in the city against liability for violating German regulations. During the following days, the insurgents are taken from the city to prisoner-of-war camps. Civilians from Warsaw, on the other hand, are sent to transit camps in Pruszków, Ursus, Włochy and Ożarów. Unfortunately, over 100,000 of them are sent for forced labour in the Reich and another several dozen thousand to concentration camps.
