        <h2>A Heroic and Tragic 63-Day Struggle</h2>
        <p>
            The Warsaw uprising began on August 1, 1944, at 5pm. Approximately 45,000 members of the Home Army (Armia Krajowa, AK) under commandment of general Antoni Chruściel joined the combat. They were supported by 2,500 soldiers from other resistance movements, such as the National Armed Forces (Narodowe Siły Zbrojne, NSZ) and the communist People's Army (Armia Ludowa, AL). Only a quarter of the partisans had access to weapons, fighting against 25,000 German soldiers equipped with artillery, tanks, and air forces.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Within the first few days of the uprising, Polish forces took over several districts of Warsaw, including downtown and the Old Town. After the initial success of the AK, German troops gradually recaptured the city. They surrounded the Old Town and various other areas around.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            'When we crush the uprising, Warsaw will get what it deserves &#8211 complete annihilation.' These were the words of Hans Frank, the head of the German government in Poland. Hitler and Himmler agreed, and Warsaw&#39;s fate was sealed. Nothing was to be spared. German troops followed Heinrich Himmler&#39;s order to destroy the city and take revenge on civilians. The bloodiest action against the inhabitants took place between August 5 and 7, 1944, when approximately 40,000 men, women, and children were murdered during massacres in the district of Wola, just outside central Warsaw. Simultaneously, the Germans initiated deportations of civilians from the city to the transit camp, Dulag 121, outside of Warsaw. They later relocated them to forced labor or to concentration camps.

        <br>
        <p>
            On September 2, after more than two weeks of combat, the last Polish soldiers left the Old Town through the sewers. Warsaw&#39;s historical district was turned into ruins. In mid-September, the Red Army took Praga, the district of Warsaw on the east bank of the Vistula River, but did not cross the river to intervene.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Towards the end of September 1944, German forces took control over further parts of Warsaw, about 85% of Warsaw had been completely destroyed, a city laid in ruins. What had once been one of the most beautiful cities in Europe was now a wasteland. On October 2, 1944, the uprising ended. The number of victims exceeded 180,000 people. More than 11,000 AK soldiers were captured as prisoners of war, including Antoni Chruściel. Soviet troops resumed their offensive much later, taking over devastated Warsaw on January 17, 1945.
